# PIN Finder

In response to [Wave FM](https://www.wavefmlive.co.uk/win/hole-in-the-wall/) "Hole In The Wall" competition. 

I've been hearing too many people not even trying to play the game and saying random numbers. 

By running the program you will see it takes about 11.5 attempts to guess the right PIN number (if the only hint is the ATM telling you that the correct one is **higher** or **lower** than what you put in).

You simply take the "middle" value between **0000** and **9999**, get the hint if incorrect, change your min or max value to your previous guess and carry on.

Eventually you end up with the correct PIN. The lowest number of attempts I got from a 100 runs was 6, the highest was 13. This is optimal path to guessing the right PIN, between 6 and 13 phone calls to Wave FM.

There, now I can go to bed...
